- Detailed frames: Nodejs only lets you see a tiny bit into the http2 frames going back and forth. Need to switch to http2 lib (all javascript) or pull out pieces of it to have a slim version that can read the actual frames.

- Stream reuse: Chrome will reuse the same stream/socket across domains and ports that resolve to the same address. This breaks safari <12.1 though, so I disabled it.

Additional tracking we should do once we have a more capable http2 frame tracker:
 - Initial window update
 - Settings Ack
 - True settings sent in SETTINGS updates (currently nodejs injects defaults)
 - Frames per packet (ie, is headers/window_update in shared packet)
 - Headers Frames
 - Data Frames
 - Continuation Frames
 - Rst Frame and GoAway
 - Padding in frames
 - Test HPack of different headers - same indices/packing across browsers?
